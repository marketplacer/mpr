A thing for making pull request details

## Installation

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/marketplacer/mpr/releases). Precompiled binaries are availabe for x64 Windows, macOS and Linux.

### macOS and Linux users

After downloading, you'll probably want to do something like:

1. `$ chmod +x the-downloaded-file`
2. `# mv the-downloaded-file /usr/local/bin/mpr` (or your preferred location on your `PATH`)

## Building

You'll need `go` installed (eventually I'll set up CI so you can download a prebuild release). Easiest way of downloading it right now is with `go get github.com/marketplacer/mpr`
